# Udacity-I2P-Stage2
A python fill-in-the-blank quiz, created as the Stage 2 project for Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree

## Purpose
This program was created as part of the Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree. It provides a quiz that tests the user's knowledge of Python terminology. After running the program, the user is prompted to select 1 of 3 difficulty levels and must then solve a fill-in-the-blank quiz.

## Running the program
From a terminal, cd to the same directory as the file and then type:
`python fill-in-the-blanks-v2.py`
This will launch the program. If at any time you wish to exit the program, type `control` and `c` simultaneously.
